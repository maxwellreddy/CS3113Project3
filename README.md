# CS3113Project3
This is my Project 3 work for CS 3113.

Instructions:

1. Run main.cpp to run the game.
2. Use the Left and Right arrow keys to move the lunar lander left and right. 
3. If you touch the grey blocks, you lose. If you land on the gold platform, you win.
4. Press the spacebar to restart the game after you win or lose.
